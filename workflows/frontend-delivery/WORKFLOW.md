# Workflow: Frontend delivery

Single-step workflow: run the frontend-engineer agent with an approved GitHub issue and frontend specification to generate frontend code via Lovable and open a PR linked to the issue.

## Before you run

- **Plan mode:** Start in plan mode. Present the plan (this workflow's steps and the inputs below). Do not execute any step until the user confirms the plan.
- **Required inputs:** Before running, prompt the user for every **required** input listed in the Inputs table. Do not execute until all required inputs are provided. Optional inputs (marked "User (optional)" in the table) may use defaults or be prompted as needed.

## Inputs

| Name | Source | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| issue_reference | User | GitHub issue in To Do (or sub-issue under a parent)—owner, repo, issue number. |
| frontend_specification | User | Screens, flows, validations. |
| api_contracts | User | Backend API endpoints and fields. |
| target_repo | User (optional) | Target repository if different from issue repo. |

## Outputs

- **PR with generated frontend** – Frontend code generated by Lovable, committed and opened as a pull request linked to the GitHub issue (Closes #N).

## Steps

1. **Run frontend-engineer** with: issue_reference, frontend_specification, api_contracts, and optionally target_repo. The agent reads the issue and spec, fetches UI/UX guidelines from Confluence if available, builds a deterministic Lovable prompt, executes it via Lovable MCP, reviews the output, commits, and opens a PR. The agent does not manually write or refactor frontend code; it relies exclusively on Lovable MCP.

## Conditionals

- None. This is a single-agent workflow.

## How to reference in Cursor

- Install to `.cursor/workflows/frontend-delivery/`.
- Run the frontend-engineer agent with the inputs above whenever a frontend feature is approved and the spec and API contracts are ready.
- An orchestrator agent can read this file and prompt for issue reference, frontend spec, and API contracts, then invoke the frontend-engineer agent.
